# Compiling
The files are written in plain Python without any dependences (other than `math`
and `random` from the standard library). You can run with `CPython` and `PyPy`.
For example:
```
python3 newtonian_black_hole.py
```
or:
```
pypy newtonian_black_hole.py
```
Please note that `CPython` takes over an hour to complete the computation.
`PyPy` miraculously finishes in less than 30 seconds.
